EXPERIMENT-6
Write a Program to implement Sliding window protocol for Go back N.
Sliding Window Protocol
The Sliding Window Protocol is a method used in computer networks to ensure reliable and efficient
data transmission between sender and receiver.
Key Concepts:
 Window Size: The number of frames that can be sent before needing an acknowledgment
(ACK).
 Acknowledgment (ACK): A signal sent by the receiver to inform the sender that a frame was
received correctly.
 Sliding Window: After receiving an ACK, the sender "slides" the window forward to send new
frames.
How it works:
1. The sender transmits up to window_size frames without waiting for ACKs.
2. The receiver sends ACKs for the frames received.
3. If an ACK is received, the window slides forward, and new frames can be sent.
4. If an ACK is not received (due to loss/error), the sender retransmits the unacknowledged
frames.
Program
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
int window_size, total_frames;
int sent = 0, ack, i;
clrscr();
// Input from user
printf("Enter window size: ");
scanf("%d", &window_size);
printf("Enter total number of frames to send: ");
scanf("%d", &total_frames);
while (sent < total_frames)
{
// Send frames in the current window
for (i = 0; i < window_size && sent < total_frames; i++)
{
printf("Frame %d has been transmitted.\n", sent);
sent++;
}
// Receive ACK
printf("Enter last ACK received (0 to %d): ", total_frames - 1);
scanf("%d", &ack);
// If ACK is valid, move window; else, go back
if (ack >= 0 && ack < total_frames)
sent = ack + 1;
else
{
printf("Invalid ACK. Resending current window.\n");
sent -= i; // Go back to start of current window
}
printf("\n");
}
printf("All frames sent and acknowledged.\n");
getch();
}
